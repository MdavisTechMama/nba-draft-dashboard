# 🏀 NBA Draft Analysis (Power BI)

This project explores NBA Draft trends, focusing on the colleges producing first-round picks, the average career length of those picks, and the likelihood of G-League (formerly D-League) players being drafted. Built entirely in Power BI, the report was exported as a PDF due to licensing restrictions.

## 📊 Key Questions Explored:
- Which colleges produce the most NBA draft picks, especially in early rounds?
- What is the average number of seasons played by first-round draft picks?
- How often are G-League players drafted into the NBA?

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using publicly available NBA draft and player statistics data, I developed a data visualization report to uncover key insights about draft patterns, player longevity, and development pipelines. The analysis highlights patterns in college performance and the underrepresentation of G-League athletes in the NBA draft process.
